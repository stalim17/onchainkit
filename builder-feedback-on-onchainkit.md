# Builder Feedback on OnchainKit

OnchainKit is a great toolkit for builders who want to ship faster on Base without reinventing the wheel.  
The component structure feels intuitive, and the documentation is clear.

A few suggestions that could make it even better:
1. Add short examples for wallet connection and transaction signing.
2. Provide guidance on using OnchainKit together with frameworks like Next.js.
3. Include a “Base-ready templates” folder so builders can test instantly.

> The easier it is to start, the faster the ecosystem grows.
